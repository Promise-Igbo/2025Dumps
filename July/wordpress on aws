## Deploying WordPress on AWS EC2 with Amazon RDS
# Launch an EC2 intsance
# Create or attach a key to your instance
# Configure the security group to allow access to HTTP (by adding or creating a security group)
# Review and launch instance

# Connect using ssh client
ssh -i "wordpress.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-218-67-187.compute-1.amazonaws.com

## Configure the instance with Apache Webserver
# I used git bash to run the command
ssh -i "wordpress.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-218-67-187.compute-1.amazonaws.com
# Note: Make sure you run the command on the download folder
sudo su - root
# install the software
yum install httpd -y
# Start the service and make it permanent
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
# Install PHP and its required packages
yum install php php-devel php-fpm php-mysqli php-json php-mysqlnd
rpm -q php8.4
php -v
# Download and extract the WordPress software
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
ls
# Upload the WordPress files in the root directory of the webserver
# Apache webserver so the root directory of the webserver is /var/www/html
mv wordpress/ /var/www/html/
# Add or Check .htaccess File
cd /var/www/html
sudo nano .htaccess
# Paste this default WordPress content:
# BEGIN WordPress

sudo chown apache:apache /var/www/html/.htaccess
sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/.htaccess

# Edit Apache config to allow .htaccess
