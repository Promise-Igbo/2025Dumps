# Add this repo: Promise-Igbo/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces
# Select the docs and the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folders
# Verify the repository appears in your sources list
# Ask Copilot spaces questions surrounding the repo

# Step 2: Explore & summarize project management processes and create a README

# Open your Copilot Space you created in the previous step. https://github.com/copilot/spaces or by clicking the name
# Start a new conversation in the Copilot Space
